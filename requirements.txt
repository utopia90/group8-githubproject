# requirements.txt a file used in Python projects to specify 
# the required external libraries and their versions. 
# This file is used for managing project dependencies.

# Below a requirements.txt file typically looks like:

# The name of the project or environment
name: group8-githubproject

# List of dependencies
dependencies:
  # Python version required
  - python=3.11.3
  # Specify the version of pip (Python package manager)
  - pip=23.1.2
  # Install Python packages using pip
  - pip:
    # Django web framework version
    - django==4.2.2
    # Django Rest Framework version
    - djangorestframework==3.14.0
    # Simple JWT authentication for Django Rest Framework
    - djangorestframework-simplejwt==5.2.2
    # Python Imaging Library (PIL) - version of Pillow
    - pillow==9.5.0

# Once you have a requirements.txt file, you can use the 
# following command to install all the listed dependencies for your project:
# This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs the packages and 
# versions specified in it. Managing dependencies using requirements.txt is 
# important for ensuring that your project runs consistently across different 
# environments and for sharing your project with others, as they can easily 
# recreate the same set of dependencies.
