#  SUMMARY ================================================================
# in this file we have the HTTP requests to the Flask web application run in the file question2_api.py 
# It is interacting with the FLsk web application's endpoints using HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE).
# This file completes the set of common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, that we started
# in the question2_api file which contains GET requests.
# We use  a separate script that acts as a client for the web application, 
# demonstrating how to interact with the web application's API.
